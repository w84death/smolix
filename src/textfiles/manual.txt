## 1. INTRODUCTION
--------------
SMOLiX is a minimalist operating system designed for x86 processors running in real mode.
It provides a unique graphical user interface with Apollo-inspired DSKY (Display & Keyboard)
command system that embraces the simplicity and raw performance of direct hardware access.

The system uses a VERB/NOUN command structure for precise control and offers comprehensive
file operations, system monitoring, virtual screen management, and includes the "Dirty Rat" game.

Key Features:
- Apollo Guidance Computer inspired DSKY interface
- Virtual screen paging system
- Built-in screen saver for CRT protection
- Comprehensive file system operations
- Real-time system monitoring
- 16-color EGA/VGA graphics support
- Multiple video modes (40x25, 80x25)

## 2. DSKY INTERFACE SYSTEM
-------------------------
SMOLiX uses a DSKY (Display & Keyboard) interface inspired by the Apollo Guidance Computer.
This system uses a two-part command structure: VERB (action) and NOUN (data object).

### DSKY Display
The DSKY interface shows:
- VERB field: Action to perform (00-99)
- NOUN field: Data object or parameter (00-99)
- Status indicators and feedback

### How to Use DSKY
1. Press 'v' to enter VERB input mode
   - The VERB field will highlight in red
   - Type a 2-digit VERB code (00-99)

2. Press 'n' to enter NOUN input mode
   - The NOUN field will highlight in red
   - Type a 2-digit NOUN code (00-99)

3. Press ENTER to execute the command
   - The system will display "Executing VERB XX NOUN XX"
   - Command will be processed and results displayed

4. Press ESC (Clear) to reset VERB and NOUN to 00

### Input Guidelines
- VERB and NOUN codes are always 2 digits (leading zeros required)
- Only digits 0-9 are accepted during input
- Invalid combinations will display "Unknown command"
- Type "VERB 00, NOUN 00" for complete help
